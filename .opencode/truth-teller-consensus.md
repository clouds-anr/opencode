# Truth-Teller Consensus — How It Works

## Overview

The Truth-Teller Consensus is a multi-model verification gate. Three AI models with **different architectures and optimization targets** independently review the same findings, then the Team Lead synthesizes their perspectives into a single recommendation.

This ensures no single model's blind spots, biases, or training gaps go unchecked.

## The Three Models

| Truth-Teller | Model | Vendor | Why It's Different |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Sonnet** | Claude Sonnet | Anthropic | Nuanced reasoning, catches subtle architectural risks, strong at reading between the lines |
| **Nova** | Amazon Nova Pro | Amazon | Practical, infrastructure-aware, AWS-native perspective |
| **Lite** | Amazon Nova Lite | Amazon | Lightweight, fast, cost-efficient model — different parameter scale surfaces different findings |

## What the Gate Catches

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|-------------|
| All three agree on a finding | **High confidence** — finding proceeds into the report unchanged |
| Two agree, one disagrees | **Flagged for review** — disagreement is surfaced to the user with both perspectives |
| One model catches a risk the others missed | **Added** — unique insights from any single model are included |
| One model identifies a factual error | **Corrected** — errors are fixed before the report is written |
| All three disagree | **Escalated to user** — the user decides; the platform doesn't guess |

## Why Two Amazon Models Plus Anthropic

Using three models from the **same vendor and same size class** produces correlated blind spots. Nova Pro and Nova Lite differ in parameter scale and optimization target, which means they diverge on cost-sensitivity, complexity thresholds, and infrastructure trade-offs. Combined with Claude's constitutional AI perspective, the trio still provides meaningful signal diversity:

- **Anthropic** (Claude Sonnet) — Constitutional AI training, strong on safety and nuance
- **Amazon** (Nova Pro) — Built for AWS workloads, pragmatic, full-capability model
- **Amazon** (Nova Lite) — Lightweight variant; catches different cost/complexity trade-offs than Nova Pro

When all three independently reach the same conclusion, confidence is high. When they diverge, that divergence itself is valuable signal.
