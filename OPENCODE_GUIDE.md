## Agents and the Tab Key

`Tab` cycles through **primary agents** only. These are the main assistants you interact with directly. The active agent is shown in the lower-right corner of the TUI.

> Switching agents with `Tab` only affects which agent handles your *next* message — the conversation history stays intact.

### Built-in primary agents

| Agent | Description |
|---|---|
| **Build** | Default. All tools enabled — for active development work. |
| **Plan** | Read-only by default. `edit` and `bash` require approval. Use this to analyze code and review a plan *before* making changes. |

### Subagents (invoked with `@`)

Subagents do **not** appear in the `Tab` cycle. They are invoked either automatically by the primary agent, or manually by `@` mentioning them in a prompt:

| Subagent | Description |
|---|---|
| `@general` | Full tool access. Multi-step tasks, parallel work. |
| `@explore` | Read-only. Fast codebase search and navigation. |
| `@scout` | Read-only. External docs and dependency research. |

Subagents run as **child sessions**. Navigate them with:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `ctrl+x` + `Down` | Enter first child session |
| `Right` | Cycle to next child session |
| `Left` | Cycle to previous child session |
| `Up` | Return to parent session |

### Custom agents and the Tab cycle

Any agent defined with `mode: primary` is added to the `Tab` cycle automatically. Use `mode: subagent` to keep it out of the cycle and accessible only via `@`. Use `mode: all` (the default) to allow both.

```md
---
description: Read-only code review
mode: primary
permission:
  edit: deny
  bash: deny
---
```

## The `.opencode` Folder

Place a `.opencode/` folder in your project root (or `~/.config/opencode/` for global config). OpenCode loads everything inside automatically.

```
.opencode/
  agents/       # Custom agent definitions (.md files)
  commands/     # Custom slash commands (.md files)
  skills/       # Agent skills (.md files)
  plugins/      # Local plugin files (.ts/.js)
  themes/       # Custom themes
```

**`AGENTS.md`** is the most important file — place it in the project root and commit it to Git. Run `/init` to generate one. It contains project-specific instructions (build commands, conventions, architecture notes) that are automatically injected into every session.

Global rules live at `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` is also supported as a fallback.

---

## `opencode.json`

Two config files control behavior. Both support JSONC (comments allowed).

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `opencode.json` | Server/runtime behavior: models, providers, tools, permissions |
| `tui.json` | TUI appearance and keybinds: theme, scroll speed, shortcuts |

**Config locations** (later overrides earlier):

1. `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — global user settings
2. `opencode.json` in project root — per-project settings (safe to commit)

### Common `opencode.json` options

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "small_model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
  "autoupdate": true,          // false | "notify"
  "snapshot": true,            // set false to disable undo/redo
  "share": "manual",           // "auto" | "disabled"
  "instructions": ["CONTRIBUTING.md", "docs/**/*.md"],
  "permission": {
    "bash": "ask",             // require approval before running bash
    "edit": "ask"
  },
  "formatter": true,           // auto-format files after edits
  "lsp": true,                 // enable LSP diagnostics
  "tools": {
    "bash": false              // disable a tool entirely
  },
  "compaction": {
    "auto": true,              // compact when context fills up
    "prune": false
  }
}
```

### Common `tui.json` options

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
  "theme": "opencode",
  "keybinds": {
    "leader": "ctrl+x",
    "command_list": "ctrl+p"
  },
  "scroll_speed": 3,
  "mouse": true,
  "attention": {
    "enabled": true,           // desktop notifications + sounds
    "sound": true,
    "volume": 0.4
  }
}
```

**Variable substitution** is available in config values:

| Syntax | Description |
|---|---|
| `{env:MY_VAR}` | Reads value from an environment variable |
| `{file:~/.secrets/key}` | Reads value from a file |

## Release Gate (ANR fork)

This fork ships a layered, mandatory release gate so upstream-sync releases can't
publish a non-functional app. A release artifact is produced only when every layer
is green for the same commit SHA:

```
typecheck -> unit -> HttpApi -> app e2e -> CLI smoke -> config-layer -> upgrade -> desktop -> publish
```

- **Static / Unit / HttpApi / App e2e** — `.github/workflows/test.yml`, on every PR
  and push to `dev`. `bun turbo test` runs every package's suite (wired in
  `turbo.json`); no `--only-failures`.
- **CLI smoke** — builds the single-file binary and runs `--version` / `--help` on
  Linux/macOS/Windows.
- **Config-layer** — loads this repo's `.opencode/` agents, skills, and commands
  against the built binary and verifies referenced skills resolve
  (`.github/scripts/validate-opencode-config.ts`).
- **Upgrade smoke** — installs the previous released version, creates state, then
  runs the build-under-test against it to catch migration regressions.
- **Desktop smoke** — launches the packaged Electron app headlessly (Linux).

`publish.yml` and `release.yml` require the reusable `test.yml` gate via `needs:`.
Upstream-sync PRs (`.github/scripts/sync-upstream.sh`) are marked ready only when
both the full-workspace typecheck and the full-workspace tests pass; otherwise they
are escalated to `needs-manual-review`. The four smoke jobs are `continue-on-error`
for the first release cycle and then re-armed.
